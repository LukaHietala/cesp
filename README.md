# Cesp (Cross-editor sharing-protocol)

A protocol for live file sharing via a protocol and server that works across multiple editors and operating systems.  
Intended to be quite minimal in it's feature set.  
Not all editors will work 100% the same, but Cesp should guarantee data integrity.

| Editor | Status |
| ------ | ------- |
| Neovim | Basic features work |
| Emacs  | Basis exists, currently only able to properly observe changes |
| Vscode | Someday |
| Vim    | Possibly someday |
